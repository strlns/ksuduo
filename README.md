# KSUDUO
## Simple Sudoku Generator

https://strlns.github.io/ksuduo/index.html

This is a toy/learning project so I can get a basic understanding of:

* **TypeScript**
* **React** (without using _create-react-app_)
* **React Hooks / Function components**
* myself (no not really)

## What does it do?

It's a Sudoku game and generator.
The number of clues is configurable. 
It works by generating a full grid and then deleting some cells.

#####Current caveats / ToDo-list:
* currently only one solver algorithm which I didn't write myself (https://github.com/mattflow/sudoku-solver)
* no solver available that returns/detects multiple solutions to a puzzle
* for this reason, the generated puzzles are not necessarily fun to play and possibly have multiple solutions
* solver doesn't run in a WebWorker, so when a really hard puzzle is generated, it blocks the UI.

In case this repo is noticed by anyone: 
It's my first React project.
Don't bother with code quality.
Still, suggestions and tips are very welcome. :)

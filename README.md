# KSUDUO
## Simple Sudoku Generator

######author: Moritz Rehbach

This is a toy project so I can get a basic understanding of:

* **TypeScript**
* **React** (without using _create-react-app_)
* myself (no not really)

## What does it do?

It generates Sudokus.

The number of clues is configurable. 
It works by generating a full grid and then deleting some cells.

Until a solver is integrated, there is no guarantee that the solutions are unique.
But the output always has at least one solution.

## What can you do with it?
You could print the Sudokus to play, but I must admit that there are probably a plethora of better similar apps.
This of course does not require any internet connection.

### What does it not do but should do? 

* Allow to actually play the game
* Integrate a solver

I could probably use a battle-proven implementation
of a solving algorithm (e.g. dancing links).
I'll probably try to implement an algorithm myself instead. 
(This is a learning project)

In case this repo is noticed by anyone: 
It's my first React project.
Don't bother with code quality.
Still, suggestions and tips are very welcome. :)
